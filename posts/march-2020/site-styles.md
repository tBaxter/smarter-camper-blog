# Styling the blog
It's not really related to the trailer, but as my comfort level with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) has risen, my embarrassment with the lack of style on this site became increasingly greater.

People once called me a web designer. That was a long time ago.

But still, one can only turn a blind eye for so long before doing _something_. I'm pretty comfortable doing all of this in real-time, in public, for anyone to see (and laugh at). So I'm also OK pushing a far-less-than perfect design out live. 

To be honest, I'm tired of spending months trying to perfect designs. I want to to focus on trying out some tools and tech I've been meaning to experiment, not seek perfection and never ship.

And so I knocked something together in a few hours and shipped. 

And it felt good. I see the appeal of 11ty for this sort of thing. It makes this sort of quick and fast experimentation and publication quick, simple and easy. It reminds me of the early days of the web, before toolchains were more important than what you were doing, and it's fun.

You're still unlikely to pry me from Python and a relational DB for a lot of things, but 11ty seems like a beautiful fit for this sort of thing.

So anyways, the site styles... honestly, there's not a whole lot to say. Probably half the CSS is still the default styles the 11ty starter blog ships with, plus a quick embed of Alfa Slab from Google fonts.

A couple of new CSS vars and _voila_. 

But again, it's a beautiful thing what you can do these days. There's no pre-processor needed, no fancy toolchain, just quick, lean raw CSS.

I'll be interested in seeing where it goes from here. There's so much you can do, and it's never been easier. Whatever I do, however I iterate on it, it'll be live.

Next up, though, will be developing a touchscreen kiosk interface in the trailer.
